# Moo - Multiplayer Digital Deduction Puzzler

## Overview
Moo is a multiplayer digital deduction puzzle game where players crack four-emoji codes with bulls and cows feedback, styled with cozy cottage-core aesthetics. It's a modern take on the classic Mastermind game using emojis instead of colored pegs.

## Game Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Two-player multiplayer**: Exactly 2 players per game
- **Emoji-based codes**: Uses 6 cottage-core emojis (🐄 🥛 🍄 🌸 🌿 🧺)
- **Bulls and Cows feedback**: Bulls = correct emoji in correct position, Cows = correct emoji in wrong position
- **Infinite rounds**: Games continue until one player wins
- **Real-time multiplayer**: Live updates using tRPC subscriptions

### Game Flow
1. **Room Creation**: One player creates a room with a 4-letter code
2. **Room Joining**: Another player joins using the room code
3. **Code Selection**: Both players secretly choose their 4-emoji codes
4. **Guessing Phase**: Players take turns making guesses simultaneously
5. **Feedback**: Each guess receives bulls and cows feedback
6. **Victory**: First player to get 4 bulls (crack the code) wins

### UI/UX Features
- **Cottage-core aesthetic**: Cozy, pastoral design with warm colors
- **Wordle-inspired interface**: Familiar grid-based guess history
- **Real-time updates**: Live synchronization between players
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Authentication required**: Discord OAuth integration

## Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19
- **Backend**: tRPC with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with Discord provider
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Package Manager**: Bun

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication and user data
- **Game Rooms**: 4-letter codes for joining games, with activity tracking for cleanup
- **Games**: Game state, player assignments, codes, and status
- **Game Moves**: Individual guesses with bulls/cows feedback

### Real-time Features
- **tRPC Subscriptions**: Live game updates via SSE
- **Event-driven architecture**: Game state changes trigger real-time updates
- **Automatic reconnection**: Handles connection drops gracefully

## Key Components

### Game Router (`src/server/api/routers/game.ts`)
- `createRoom`: Creates new game rooms
- `joinRoom`: Joins existing rooms
- `getGameState`: Retrieves current game state
- `setPlayerCode`: Sets player's secret code
- `makeGuess`: Submits guesses and calculates feedback
- `subscribeToGameUpdates`: Real-time subscription for game events

### UI Components
- **EmojiPicker**: Interactive code selection with visual feedback
- **GameBoard**: Wordle-style guess history with bulls/cows display
- **RoomControls**: Room creation and joining interface

### Game Utils (`src/lib/game-utils.ts`)
- Bulls and cows calculation algorithm
- Emoji-to-index conversion for storage
- Room code generation
- Code validation utilities

## Environment Setup

Required environment variables:
```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./db.sqlite"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="your-discord-client-id"
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="your-discord-client-secret"
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run development server
bun dev

# Run linting and type checking
bun check

# Database operations
bun run db:push      # Push schema changes
bun run db:studio    # Open database studio
```

## Game Logic

### Bulls and Cows Algorithm
```typescript
// Bulls: correct emoji in correct position
// Cows: correct emoji in wrong position
const calculateBullsAndCows = (guess: string, secret: string) => {
  // Implementation handles duplicates correctly
  // Returns { bulls: number, cows: number }
}
```

### Real-time Synchronization
- Uses tRPC subscriptions with Server-Sent Events
- Event-driven updates for all game state changes
- Automatic reconnection with lastEventId tracking

## Cottage-core Design Elements

### Color Palette

- **🔄 Periodic Cleanup**: Background service runs every 2 minutes to clean up old rooms
- **🛡️ Safety Checks**: Multiple validation layers before room deletion
- **🚀 Performance**: Prevents database bloat from abandoned rooms

This implementation provides a robust foundation for a multiplayer deduction puzzle game with modern web technologies, seamless sharing capabilities, and a delightful cottage-core aesthetic.
